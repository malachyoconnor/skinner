BUG: End of the timer is counted as the end of you work interval! Not when the timer started!!
    Just update the file as soon as we start out break!

SEGFAULT: Trying to stat from inside the archive directory cause a segfault:
 - ../build/skinner stats 2025-10-09.txt

BUG: Stats seems to give the same value every time...?

Change the timers to do calculation based on current time
    Skeptical about their behaviour during sleep...
Change the break timer to automatically resume the session
Do some RAII stuff so they can do Ctrl^C without issue
